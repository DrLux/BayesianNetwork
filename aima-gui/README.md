This project contains graphical applications and command line demos. The command line demos show
how to use selected parts of the aima-core API. Their code is structured as simple as possible
and should be easy to read and understand. The graphical applications support interactive experiments with
some of the core algorithms, especially from the search and logic area. Based on practical application
scenarios, different algorithms can be tested and compared with various parameter settings.
 
Application class names end with "App" and command line demo class names end with "Demo".
Simple demo command line applications can be found in package [aima.gui.demo](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/tree/AIMA3e/aima-gui/src/main/java/aima/gui/demo).
Graphical demo applications are available based on JavaFX (package [aima.gui.fx.applications](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/tree/AIMA3e/aima-gui/src/main/java/aima/gui/fx/applications)) and
Swing (package [aima.gui.swing.applications](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/tree/AIMA3e/aima-gui/src/main/java/aima/gui/swing/applications)). Each platform-specific root package contains an
integrated application providing access to all integrable applications. The individual applications are placed
in sub-packages.

Note that JavaFX and Swing applications are structured quite differently.
They use different frameworks (sub-package framework) and also differ in function. The JavaFX framework
is the newer of the two. It uses newer technology, its code design is more elegant, and already now more applications are available.
Experiment execution can be controlled with just one button (try Mouse-Right on the rightmost button to
toggle between StepMode and VeryFast). For more information about the design see the [Wiki](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/wiki/AIMA3e-GUI-FX-Framework).

### Requirements
Depends on the aima-core project. 

### Current Release
#### 1.1.1-JavaFX GUIs Added : 18 Dec 2016 (outdated)
 * Fixed Jar to launch JavaFX Integrated App by default.
  
### Running the GUIs and Command Line Demos
Under the `release` directory you should find two jar files, `aima-core.jar` and `aima-gui.jar`,
ensure these are on your CLASSPATH, the different GUI programs that can be run using these are:
 * `java -jar aima-gui.jar`
   * this will run the default IntegratedAimaFxApp. It allows you to run all other JavaFX applications from a central location as well as all of the current command line demos.
* `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.swing.applications.IntegratedAimaApp`
   * this will run the Swing version of the integrated AIMA application.

JavaFX and Swing demo applications can be started directly.
 
The following command line demos can be run as well:
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.agent.TrivialVacuumDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.learning.LearningDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.DpllDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.FolDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.PlFcEntailsDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.PLResolutionDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.TTEntailsDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.WalkSatDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.probability.ProbabilityDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.CSPDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.EightPuzzleDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.NQueensDemo`
 * `java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.TicTacToeDemo`
