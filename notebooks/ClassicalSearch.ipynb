    "Search algorithms work by considering various possible **action sequences**. The possible action sequences starting at the initial state form a **search tree** with the initial state at the root then **expanding** current state to form branches. The nodes correspond to states in the state space of the problem. We expand the current state by applying each legal action to the current state, thereby generating a new set of $b$ states. We add $b$ branches from the **parent node** leading to $b$ new **child node**. Each of these $b$ child nodes is a **leaf node**, that is, a node with no children in the tree. The set of all leaf nodes available  for expansion at any given point is called the **frontier**. The process of expanding nodes on the frontier continues until either a goal state is reached or there are no more states to expand. \n",
