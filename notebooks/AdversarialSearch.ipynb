    "This notebook serves as supporting material for the chapter Adversarial Search. Mathematical **game theory** views any multiagent environment as a game, provided that impact of each agent on the other is \"significant\", regardless of whether the agents are cooperative or competitive. In this chapter we cover **competitive** environments, in which the agents' goals are in conflict, giving rise to **adversarial search** problems-often known as **games**. The discussion begins with a definition of the optimal move and an algorithm for finding it. We then look at techniques for choosing a good move when the time is limited. "

    "### Optimal decisions in multiplayer games\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we need to replace the single value for each node with a _vector_ of values. For example, in a 3-player game with players A, B, and C, a vector $<v_a, v_b, v_c>$ is associated with each node. For terminal states, this vector gives the utility of the state from each player's viewpoint. The simplest way to implement this is to have the $UTILITY$ function return a vector of utilities. Hence the backed-up value of a node $n$ is always the utility vector of the successor state with the highest value for the player playing at $n$. It is important to notice that multiplayer games usually involve **alliances** among the players. Alliances are made and broken as the game proceeds. For example, suppose A and B are in a weak position and C is in a stronger position. then it is often optimal for both A and B to attack C rather than each other, lest C destroy each of them individually. In this way, collaboration emerges with purely selfish behavior. Of course, as soon as C weakens, the alliance loses its value, and either A or B could violate the agreement. "

    "## Alpha-Beta Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with minimax search is that  the number of game states it has to examine is exponential in the depth of the tree. Unfortunately, we can't eliminate the exponent, but we can effectively cut it in half. The trick is that it is possible to compute the correct minimax decision without looking at every node in the game tree. The particular technique, called **alpha-beta pruning**, when applied to a standard minimax tree, returns the same move as the minimax would, but prunes away the branches that cannot influence the final decision. Alpha-beta pruning can be applied to trees of any depth, and it is often possible to prune entire subtrees rather than just leaves. The general principle is: consider a node $n$ somewhere in the tree such that player has a choice of moving to that node. If the player has a better choice $m$ either at the parent node of $n$ or at any choice-point further up, then  _n will never be reached in actual play_. So once we have found out enough about $n$ to reach this conclusion, we can prune it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha and Beta are the 2 parameters that describe bounds on the backed-up value that appear anywhere along the path:\n",
    "* $\\alpha$ = the highest value choice we have found so far at any choice-point along the path i.e. value of the best choice found so far for MAX\n",
    "* $\\beta$ = the lowest value choice we have found so far at any choice-point along the path i.e. value of the best choice found so far for MIN\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha-beta search updates the value of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as it goes along and prunes the remaining branch at a node as soon as the vvalue of the current node  is known to be worse than the current $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ value for MAX and MIN respectively."
